Each Higher Educational Institute (HEI) in the Netherlands can request its institute-specific files named "Bekostigingsbestanden". The functions in this package extract information from these files related to switching studies. It facilitates the HEIs gain insight in the prevalence of switching studies. Flows can be visualised by a Sankey diagram.

## Installation

You can install the development version of wisselstroom from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ed2c/wisselstroom")
```

If you want to have the vignettes as well:  

``` r
devtools::install_github("ed2c/wisselstroom", dependencies = TRUE, build_vignettes = TRUE)
```




## Example

Read in your VLPBEK file with `read_bek_data()`:

``` r
path_to_file <- here::here("extdata", "VLPBEK_2025_20240115_99XX.csv")
my_vlpbek_data <- read_bek_data(path_to_file)
```

This results in one large data set. Hidden in that data set are different sub data sets, which contain information about enrolment and degrees. 

<!-- To ease the access to this information, make a `vlpbek` object with the function `vlpbek()`:   -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- my_vlpbek <- vlpbek(my_vlpbek_data) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Gain insights by using the `compact_vlpbek` function. The resulting object contains summary information related to switching HEIs and/or programs, which can be plotted using for instance `plot_brinflows()`: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- my_vlpbek_compact <- compact_vlpbek(my_vlpbek) -->
<!-- plot_brinflows(my_vlpbekcompact, display_labels = TRUE) -->
<!-- ``` -->
